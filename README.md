## DataStructure-Algorithm
#### HuffmanCodes: 
## Files:
***HuffmanCodes.java***  
***BitInputStream.java***  
***BitOutputStream.java***

## Usage: 

1. Compile all the java files
    ***javac *.java***

2. 
  
  a) Run huffman compression algorithm

    ***$ java HuffmanCodes***
  
  Usage: java HuffmanCodes MODE [OPTIONS...] IN OUT  
  
  MODE is one of:  

    > -e   Encodes file IN to file OUT
  
    > -d   Decodes file IN to file OUT  
  
  OPTIONS are zero or more of:

    > -F   Show the frequencies of each byte

    > -C   Show the codes for each byte
  
    > -B   Show the encoded sequence in binary
